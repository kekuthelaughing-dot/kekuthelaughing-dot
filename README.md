I am currently developing **The Heavy Lifting Prototype (V6.6)**, a hybrid engine designed to bridge the gap between local mobile-edge inference and high-fidelity cloud synthesis.

## 🛠 Currently Researching:
* **Mobile-Edge Vision:** Deploying Moondream2 via llama.cpp on Android (Termux).
* **Hybrid Generation:** Optimizing Flux.1-schnell and Flux.1-dev pipelines for anatomical symmetry.
* **System Logic:** Implementing "Preset Stacking" and strict geometry constraints for automated prompt engineering.

## ⚡ Technical Stack:
* **Languages:** Python, Shell, HTML/JavaScript.
* **Environments:** Termux (Linux on Android), GitHub Actions.
* **Models:** Flux.1 (Schnell/Dev), Moondream2, Llama.cpp.
